# Add tracks from *song* (❤️️) to a playlist
This piece of JS code adds track from *song* (❤️️) section to a particular playlist in JioSaavn web app.
Since desktop version of JioSaavn does not have the *song* section, thus the easiest way to download them all on any device is to add tracks to a playlist in web app and then download the entire playlist.
🤔Umm.. also, did i mention that this demonstrate the ideal case of promise callback hell. Peace ✌.
